            it invests the money in equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities. Each investor
            owns
            units, which represent a portion of the holdings of the fund. The income/gains generated from this
            collective
            investment are distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting certain expenses, by
            calculating a scheme’s “Net Asset Value”. Mutual Fund is one of the most viable investment options for the
            common man as it offers an opportunity to invest in a diversified, professionally managed basket of
            securities
            at a relatively low cost.</p>
